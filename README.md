**Modern block editor support for IndieWeb post kinds and microformats.** A successor to the classic [IndieWeb Post Kinds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/) plugin by David Shanske.

Share what you're listening to, watching, reading, and experiencing—all on your own website with full Gutenberg support.

## About This Plugin

This plugin is a modern, block-editor compatible successor to David Shanske's [IndieWeb Post Kinds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/) plugin. It maintains compatibility with the same post kind concepts and IndieWeb microformats while adding full Gutenberg support.

**Why a new plugin?**
