## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need IndieBlocks installed?</strong></summary>

No, but it's recommended. IndieBlocks provides the core blocks for bookmarks, likes, replies, and reposts. Post Kinds for IndieWeb extends these with additional post kinds (listen, watch, read, etc.) and enhanced features.

Without IndieBlocks, you can still use the reaction post kinds and custom blocks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I set up API keys?</strong></summary>

1. Go to Settings → Post Kinds for IndieWeb → API Settings
2. Enter your API keys for the services you want to use:
   - TMDB (for movies/TV): [Get key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
   - Last.fm (for music): [Get key](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
3. Save settings

Some APIs (MusicBrainz, Open Library) don't require keys.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why aren't my reactions showing up?</strong></summary>

Check these common causes:

1. **Post Kind not set**: Ensure the post has a reaction type selected in the editor
2. **Template issue**: Your theme needs to support the post content or use our patterns
3. **Caching**: Clear all caches after making changes
4. **JavaScript error**: Check browser console for errors
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I import from external services?</strong></summary>

1. Go to Tools → Reactions Import
2. Select the service (Trakt, Last.fm, etc.)
3. Connect your account or upload an export file
4. Configure import options
5. Click Import

Note: Initial imports may take time for large libraries.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why isn't the media search finding anything?</strong></summary>

1. Check API key is entered (for TMDB, Last.fm)
2. Verify the service isn't rate-limited
3. Try different search terms
4. Check Settings → Post Kinds for IndieWeb → Debug for API errors
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I customize the block appearance?</strong></summary>

Options in order of complexity:

1. **Block settings**: Use the sidebar controls in the editor
2. **Global styles**: Customize via Appearance → Editor → Styles
3. **Additional CSS**: Add custom CSS via Customizer or theme
4. **Child theme**: Create template overrides
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why aren't microformats showing correctly?</strong></summary>

1. Use [pin13.net/mf2](https://pin13.net/mf2/) to test your pages
2. Ensure your theme doesn't strip HTML classes
3. Check that no caching plugin is modifying output
4. Verify the post has proper metadata filled in
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this without the block editor?</strong></summary>

The custom blocks require the block editor (Gutenberg). However:
- Post kinds work with Classic Editor (limited UI)
- Meta fields can be set programmatically
- Shortcodes may be added in future versions
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I contribute translations?</strong></summary>

1. Generate .pot file: `wp i18n make-pot . languages/post-kinds-indieweb.pot`
2. Create translation using [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or similar
3. Submit via pull request or [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this compatible with [other plugin]?</strong></summary>

Known compatible:
- IndieBlocks (recommended)
- IndieAuth
- Webmention
- Syndication Links
- Most SEO plugins
- Most caching plugins

Known issues:
- None reported yet

If you find an incompatibility, please report it!
