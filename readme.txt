= About This Plugin =

This plugin is a modern, block-editor compatible successor to David Shanske's IndieWeb Post Kinds plugin. It maintains compatibility with the same post kind concepts and IndieWeb microformats while adding full Gutenberg support.

**Why a new plugin?**
* The original Post Kinds plugin is incompatible with the Block Editor
* WordPress has evolved—block themes and the Block Bindings API offer new possibilities
* Modern APIs and import capabilities enhance the experience

= Related Plugins =

**Recommended:**

* [IndieBlocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieblocks/) - Core IndieWeb blocks for bookmarks, likes, replies, reposts, and context
* [Syndication Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/) - Stores and displays syndication URLs for POSSE workflows
* [Webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) - Cross-site conversations and notifications

**Optional:**

* [ActivityPub](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/) - Federation with Mastodon and the Fediverse
* [Bookmark Card](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bookmark-card/) - Enhanced bookmark previews

**Conflicts:**

* [Post Kinds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-post-kinds/) - This plugin is the block editor successor to Post Kinds. Use one or the other, not both.

* PHP 8.0 or higher

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need IndieBlocks installed? =

No, but it's recommended. IndieBlocks provides core blocks for bookmarks, likes, replies, and reposts. Post Kinds for IndieWeb adds complementary post kinds (listen, watch, read, etc.).

= How do I get API keys? =

Go to Settings → Post Kinds for IndieWeb → API Settings. Each service has a link to get your API key. Some services (MusicBrainz, Open Library) don't require keys.

= Can I import my existing data? =

Yes! Go to Tools → Post Kinds Import to import from Last.fm, Trakt, Goodreads exports, and more.

= Does this work with the Classic Editor? =

The custom blocks require the block editor. Basic post kind functionality works with Classic Editor but with limited UI.

= How do I customize the block appearance? =

Use the block sidebar settings in the editor, Global Styles in the Site Editor, or add custom CSS to your theme.

= Is my data private? =

All data is stored on your WordPress site. External API calls only retrieve public metadata; your posts are not shared with external services unless you explicitly syndicate them.

= Can I use this alongside the original Post Kinds plugin? =

No. This plugin is designed as a replacement for the original Post Kinds plugin. Using both will cause conflicts. Deactivate the original Post Kinds plugin before activating this one.
